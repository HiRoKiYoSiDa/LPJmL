.SH DESCRIPTION
Program checks the syntax of LPJmL configuration files. It is checked additionally whether all input files and output directories are present. 
\fBlpjcheck\fP will print the total amount of disk space used for the output files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h,\--help
display a short help text
.TP
\-v,\--version

Only error messages are displayed, other output is suppressed.
.TP
\-nocheck
Does not check for input/output files
.TP
\-vv
verbosely print the actual values during reading of the configuration files.
.TP
\-ofiles
List only all available output variables.
.TP
\-param

.TP
\-nopp
Disabling preprocessing of configuration file by \fBcpp\fP.
.TP
\-pp cmd
Set preprocessor program to cmd. Default is \fBcpp\fP.
.TP
\-couple host[:port]
set host where the coupled model is running. Default is localhost. Port is the port number for ingoing and outgoing data. Default port number is 2224.
.TP
\-outpath \fIdir\fP
set the output directory path. The path is added to the output filenames if they do not contain an absolute path.
.TP
\-inpath \fIdir\fP
set the input directory path. The path is added to the input filenames if they do not contain an absolute path.
.TP
\-Dmacro[=value]
define macro for the preprocessor of the configuration file
.TP
\-I\fIdir\fP
define include directory for the preprocessor of the configuration file
.TP
.I filename
name of configuration file
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Check configuration file lpjml.cjson with input files located in the /p/projects/lpjml file system
.B lpjcheck
\-inpath /p/projects/lpjml lpjml.cjson
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
LPJPREP 
defines preprocessor command for LPJmL configuration file, default is \fBcpp\fP. Same as '-pp' option.
.TP
LPJROOT
defines the root directory for LPJmL. This directory is added to the
include directories of the preprocessor
.TP
LPJINPATH
Path appended to the input filenames. Only done for filenames without absolute path.
.TP
LPJOPTIONS     
runtime options for the preprocessor of LPJmL configuration files
.TP
LPJOUTPATH
Path appended to the output filenames. Only done for filenames without absolute path.
.TP
LPJRESTARTPATH
Path appended to the restart filenames. Only done for filenames without absolute path.

.SH EXIT STATUS
